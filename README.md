# simpleLambdaCloudformation
Very simple Lambda function that is uploaded to AWS using Cloudformation

## Prerequisites 
You do need to have the AWS CLI installed and configured for this to work.

## How to use this
This is as simple as it gets, I included a script called `deploy.sh` which 
will make it even easier to deploy

Run it like this:

`./deploy.sh YourS3BucketName NameOfCloudFormation template.yml`
